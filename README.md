I wrote this <a href = "https://github.com/Pranav-20186017/usl-img_recog/blob/master/img_to_csv.py">this </a> script to extract the pixels from the images and convert them into a csv.

Then I read the read the data from this csv file and applied PCA on the data and built the necessary classifiers and tested them 

The summary for the same can be found in the jupyter notebook
